## Purpose
This is a CMS-style blog site created so that beer lovers can have a space to publish their own posts, intecact with other peoples posts and have their own dashboard with their personal information, their posts, and other cool features. This application follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
